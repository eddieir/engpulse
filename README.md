# EngPulse

**Engineering clarity for non-technical leaders.**

EngPulse turns GitHub activity into plain-English weekly reports that CEOs, CTOs, and founders can understand in 30 seconds.

---

## The Problem

Most engineering tools are built for engineers — dashboards full of technical jargon, raw metrics, and charts that don't answer the questions leadership actually asks:

- Are we moving fast enough?
- What is blocking delivery?
- Are bugs increasing?
- What should I tell the CEO or board this week?

EngPulse solves this by translating GitHub activity into **plain-English leadership insight**.

---

## Target Users

- CTOs at startups with 5–50 engineers

## Running Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/engpulse.git
cd engpulse
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

---

## Deploy to Netlify

```bash
npm install -g netlify-cli
netlify init
netlify deploy --build
netlify deploy --prod
```

Or connect your GitHub repo in the Netlify dashboard for automatic deployments (build command: `npm run build`).

---

## Environment Variables

```bash
# .env.local (not required for MVP — all mock data)
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your_github_client_id
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your_github_client_secret
GITHUB_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback
```

---

## Adding Real GitHub Data

1. **Implement OAuth** — Add `/api/auth/github` and `/api/auth/callback` routes
2. **Store token securely** — Database or encrypted session
3. **Replace mock returns** in `src/lib/services/githubClient.ts` — each function has a TODO comment showing the real API call
4. **Replace mock imports** in pages — swap `mockRepositories` etc. for async service calls

---

## Integrations Roadmap

| Integration | Status |
|-------------|--------|
| GitHub | ✅ Live (mock, OAuth-ready) |
| Slack | 🔜 Coming soon |
| Jira | 🔜 Coming soon |
| Linear | 🔜 Coming soon |
| Notion | 🔜 Coming soon |
| GitLab | 🔜 Coming soon |
| Bitbucket | 🔜 Coming soon |
| Azure DevOps | 🔜 Coming soon |
